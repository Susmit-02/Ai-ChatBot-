# Ai-ChatBot-
This project is a Python-based AI chatbot designed to automatically respond to messages when the user is unavailable. It helps maintain communication by sending intelligent auto-replies in the user’s absence. 

The chatbot can:
Detect when the user is unavailable
Send automated replies to incoming messages
Respond with predefined or rule-based messages
Simulate basic conversational behavior
This project showcases the implementation of Python, chatbot logic, and automation concepts to build a simple yet effective auto-reply system.
